SUMMARIZER

Objective of Summarizer The aim of this project is to generate, from any comparison matrix, "summaries" of interesting trends or facts in the products or characteristics of the matrix. Each member of this project must be able to: • understand the existing project (requirements, specificity of technologies and scope, architecture, etc.) • to contribute very concretely to the project both at the level of the code (cases of tests, additions of functionalities, refactoring, etc.), documentation, or the implementation of continuous integration. • To master a set of technologies (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JUnit, etc.) and important techniques. • adapt to the evolution of this project and its requirements. • work collectively. • To keep the rendering dates. • To validate requirements and implementation on an ongoing basis.

RESULTS In our class ApiCalculStat.Java, we performed the different calculations: Average, Min, Max, and Correlation. Our hand is in the App.Java class which allows us to have the min, max and the average of a feature in a matrix. We can also have the number of occurrences of words, also the number of times we have a Boolean, and the correlation. When the correlation is between 0.5 and 1 or between -0.5 and -1, it can be said that the different features are correlated with one another.
